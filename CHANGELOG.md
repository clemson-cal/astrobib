# Changelog

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-25

### Added
- Actions apply to the check-selection: with rows selected via `Space`, remove (`d`), star (`s`), clear cached PDFs (`X`), and download PDFs (`p`) act on the whole selection. PDF downloads run as a sequential batch with progress and a downloaded/failed summary; starring follows the any-unstarred-then-star-all rule.
- Single-paper actions (references `R`, citations `c`, browser download `B`) target the selected row when exactly one is selected, and are disabled while several rows are selected.
- Key listings always show every action, with unavailable actions dimmed instead of hidden.
- `D` shows/hides the pub card; `z` re-shows a hidden card.
- The library table expands into the freed space when the pub card is hidden: the title column is elastic and recomputes on any resize.
- Installation section in the README covering uv, pipx, and venv + pip.

### Fixed
- Action enablement (for example Open PDF) now updates immediately when the selection changes on the library tab.
- Cursor position survives library table rebuilds.
